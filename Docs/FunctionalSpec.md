We, as a team setting up our environment to startup our group project with the following developing members:
1. Sabri Said
2. Szenczi Boldizsar

we have agreed to develop a blog application,the application will let the user to become a blogger by allowing them to post thier content,Currently we are working on documentation which is an integral part of our application.This will give us ideas so that we will have a better understanding when it comes to implementation of our project.

## UI Plan

The interface will be a not so complicated one, a simple login screen only and a dashboard that will have buttons such as; add item, remove item, produce slip, etc. No database will be used since this is a small project, everything will be hardcoded into the project. With this simple design we aim to provide an easy interface that doesnt require much training leaving less stress on the owners to train new employees. 

the interface will be very simple,nice styled register and login and home page that will have some buttons and labels for like posting or deleting a post/picture or whatever the user can do.database as well to store the user information,with this project we will provide a simple design no matter how much training does it need,as long as it easy for the user to use.

## Use Cases

## User cases

- A visitor can become a blog user by register
- After loging in using a user id as well as password then the system gives blog user the appropriate permissions to operate on the blog site
- User exit: blog users who have logged in can exit and release their own information resources
- Blog users can publish their own articles, including topics, text, expressions, pictures and other information, the author through various elements to show their ideas. The system receives the information and stores it in the database on the server side
- Blog users can delete their own published articles and information, and the system will automatically delete these records in the server-side database
- In addition to querying, browsing and commenting articles, the system administrator of blog can also modify and delete all articles and comments in the system. These maintenance and management have the highest authority, and the system automatically updates the data in the server-side database
-Blog administrators can add and delete new  blog users. He can also add, delete and set the appearance of the blog home page, plug-ins and tools used by the blog
