System design
========

## Introduction
With the increasing urge for people to move more and more into Digital, it is axiomatic that people will most likely move more into blogs rather than newspaper articles. We think A blog that will bre best suited for the public is of paramount importance since it is both inviting for the writers and readers.

## Project plan

1. Blog Project

2. Scrum Master : Wade Friedrichs

3. Team Memmbers: 
 3.1. Sabri Said
 3.2. Szenczi Boldizsar
 3.3. Wan Shiyi
 3.4. Yuldashov Rasul
 3.5. Friedrichs Wade David
 3.6. Silabela Mxolisi

4. eadline for all tasks are the same: 15/12/2020

5. Estimated Budget for the project is 20.000.000 Ft


## Overview
The team is developing a blog application in php, we want all CRUD functionality on posts, be able to register new accounts to create posts, and be able to log out of those accounts. our database is managed with phpmyadmin and is being hosted on a local server per machine for the sake of testing our application and making sure it works.


## Context
Everyone at this time has the required knowledge to make this project work, we would like to see all pages implemented in the first month and having all the fucntionality in the second month. any remaining time can be spent on making the website look better. main causes for concern would be to get the full working application out as soon as possible to comply with deadlines and get our grades. the appearance of the website can be changed as the team feels, for us whatis important is to get the functionality out.


## Goals and Non-Goals
The Goals section should:

describe the user-driven impact of your project ' where your user might be another engineering team or even another technical system
specify how to measure success using metrics ' bonus points if you can link to a dashboard that tracks those metrics
Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won't be fixing so everyone is on the same page.


## Milestones
A list of measurable checkpoints, so your PM and your manager's manager can skim it and know roughly when different parts of the project will be done. I encourage you to break the project down into major user-facing milestones if the project is more than 1 month long.

Use calendar dates so you take into account unrelated delays, vacations, meetings, and so on. It should look something like this:

Start Date: June 7, 2018
Milestone 1 ' New system MVP running in dark-mode: June 28, 2018
Milestone 2 - Retire old system: July 4th, 2018
End Date: Add feature X, Y, Z to new system: July 14th, 2018

Add an [Update] subsection here if the ETA of some of these milestone changes, so the stakeholders can easily see the most up-to-date estimates.


## Existing Solution
In addition to describing the current implementation, you should also walk through a high level example flow to illustrate how users interact with this system and/or how data flow through it.

A user story is a great way to frame this. Keep in mind that your system might have different types of users with different use cases.


## Proposed Solution
Some people call this the Technical Architecture section. Again, try to walk through a user story to concretize this. Feel free to include many sub-sections and diagrams.

Provide a big picture first, then fill in lots of details. Aim for a world where you can write this, then take a vacation on some deserted island, and another engineer on the team can just read it and implement the solution as you described.


## Alternative Solutions
What else did you consider when coming up with the solution above? What are the pros and cons of the alternatives? Have you considered buying a 3rd-party solution ' or using an open source one ' that solves this problem as opposed to building your own?


## Testability, Monitoring and Alerting
I like including this section, because people often treat this as an afterthought or skip it all together, and it almost always comes back to bite them later when things break and they have no idea how or why.


## Cross-Team Impact
How will this increase on call and dev-ops burden?
How much money will it cost?
Does it cause any latency regression to the system?
Does it expose any security vulnerabilities?
What are some negative consequences and side effects?
How might the support team communicate this to the customers?


## Open Questions
Any open issues that you aren't sure about, contentious decisions that you'd like readers to weigh in on, suggested future work, and so on. A tongue-in-cheek name for this section is the 'known unknowns'.


## Detailed Scoping and Timeline
This section is mostly going to be read only by the engineers working on this project, their tech leads, and their managers. Hence this section is at the end of the doc.

Essentially, this is the breakdown of how and when you plan on executing each part of the project. There's a lot that goes into scoping accurately, so you can read this post to learn more about scoping.

I tend to also treat this section of the design doc as an ongoing project task tracker, so I update this whenever my scoping estimate changes. But that's more of a personal preference.
