__Project name__
the project name is : **Blog**

![blog](/images/Blogging.png)

__Purpose__
Build a blog application that can complete the functions of personal blog users glogging in,register, publishing, browsing, modifying articles and image videos, messages, comments and even personalizing the layout of blog sites.
the blog can do a lot of stuff for the user(blogger) :
* add content to the blog which can be like articales,images,videos.
* users will have a platform in which they can put thier own stuff and change it whenever they want to.

__User needs__
User needs to be able to register if he or she wants to be blogger.
User needs to be able to log in to post something, delete posts.
User needs to be able to  publish articles, blogs and write comments.

__Project outline__
The project is a simple blog application which can allow the users to add thier own content. there shall be php pages, one for logging in. others for registring and errors to show them whenever a user does something wrong and lead them to what should be done . the project should be a blog that will handle all user needs. Therefore we are going to use php to control the access,for example the home page shouldn't be accessed without log in,on the other hand we will use javascript to implement some functions like when user wants to submit an articale he or she writes,and this actually will make the junior developers knowledge and allowing them to contribute alot to the projects development. by using classes we can divide the work into neat bundles of code which offer alot of functionality while stil being very readable. Having a class for "users" having tostring methods which can be printed on the till slip for example. simple functionality that will make code neater throughout the entire project. All and all the project is a very simple one. 

__current situation__
As the world gets more and more efficent technology needs to move along with it, and so we have the idea to create a simple blog, which will help users to share thier content,mybe some stuff about thier life so it will actually have an application that will allow them to do that, so we wish to make it simpler. we have a team of 6 who will help us in developing this application. 

__Goal__

One of the goal is to know how to be a part of a team in the software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com, and spread the tasks for each member of the team. But our main goal is to make the life of both the blogger and user easier with an application which is easy to use . Our hopes is to streamline the checkout process with this software which can help out users who will be blogging in our application.
